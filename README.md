# AboutMe App


## Description

This project will get you started learning Programmatic UI and Programmatic Auto Layout. Much of iOS development is building the UI and making it interactive for users so that is what we'll be focusing on with this app. Through this app, you'll get more comfortable with building UI, working in Xcode, and using version control.

## What you'll learn

* How to use Git with GitHub 
* Setting up your project to use MVC
* Removing Storyboard and replacing it with Programmatic UI
* Adding constraints using Auto Layout 
* Different types of views provided by Apple's UIKit framework
* Rounding Views with Apple's CALayer class
* Common Xcode shortcuts
* When to add MARKs to separate your code 

## What you'll be building

This app is an About Me app. The main goal of the app is to display basic info about yourself. It's common for people to have portfolio websites with information about themselves and projects they're working on. Think of this as the app alternative!
